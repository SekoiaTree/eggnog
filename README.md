# eggnog ðŸŽ„
`eggnog` is a tool that allows you to download [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzle inputs, puzzle directions, and submit your answers in the terminal.
#

## Installation
`eggnog` works on MacOS and Linux.
```
make install
```

## Run Tests
```
make tests
```

## Usage
```
nog [--day=<day> --year=<year>] [OPTION] 
```

Day & year are required unless Advent is happening - latest puzzle will automatically
be returned.
```
    -y <year>, --year=<year>
	The year of the puzzle you want to do.

    -d <day>, --day=<day>
	The day of the puzzle you want to do.
```

**Options**:
If no options are supplied, input is assumed.
```
    -i, --input
	Download puzzle input.

    -p, --directions
	Get puzzle directions.

    -s, --submit=<answer>
	submit an answer to a puzzle. If no answer is supplied, read from
	stdin. Using '-s' automatically reads from stdin.

    -l <puzzle part>, --level=<puzzle part>
	Indicate whether submitting an answer to part 1 or part 2 of a puzzle.
	If left out, part 1 is assumed. Required for submitting part 2 answers.
```
Getting the puzzle input will print it to the terminal in the same way it would with `curl`.
The purpose of that is because many advent of code solutions read from `stdin` rather than a hardcoded file name in the code.


### Example usage
Get input for year 2020 day 1:  
- `nog -y 2020 -d 1`
- or save to a file --> `nog -y 2020 -d 1 > input.txt`
- or pipe it into your program -->   `nog -y 2020 -d 1 | ./myprogram`

Submit an answer for year 2020 day 1 part 1:  
- `nog -y 2020 -d 1 --submit=1234`  

Or read from `stdin` to provide your answer:  
- `./myprogram | nog -y 2020 -d 1 -s`  

Submit an answer for part 2:  
- `nog -y 2020 -d 1 --part=2 -s`

## Cache
`eggnog` creates a local cache in the `$HOME` directory called `.eggnog`.  

Puzzle directions, inputs, and all right and wrong answer submission attempts are saved. The cache is always checked before querying Advent of Code servers.

Unless the cache is deleted, any query to the servers happens only once.
